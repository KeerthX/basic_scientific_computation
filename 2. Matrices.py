#Matrices are an important part of Scientific Computation, they are used to plot graphs, simplify computation of linear equations and much more 
# In this section we will study about Matrices using the numpy package

import numpy as np 

#Ways to create an array 
a = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]) #This makes a 3x3 matrix with each [] representing a row
